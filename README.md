### Hello there!

I am Nanabi, a german Streamer and Hobby Arrtist. Me and some Friends are currently working on our new (and first) game!
So I am currently learning C#, Unity! I already learned some HTML, Java, JavaScript and C. 
You can ask me about anything, but don't expect too much - I am still an university student. (I do study Game Development and Filmproduction as well as Animation).
You can reach me on my socials.

Pronouns: She/Her They/Them
Fun Fact: I am obsessed with dragons!
